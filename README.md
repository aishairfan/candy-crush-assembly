### candy-crush-assembly
#A candy crush mockup created in 16-bit MASM.
This is a fully functional mockup of the actual candycrush game comprising of 3 levels.
For each level there are boards with different patterns, candies can be swapped and a match of two or more candies eliminates them.
Moves and scores are updated accordingly and a match of 5 candies places a color bomb on the screen.
